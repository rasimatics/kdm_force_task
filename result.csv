view on the fountain (in a distance)","definitely not on the standard of a 4 star hotel!

several COCKROACHES in the room! 
found them on the second and third day in the wardrobe / climbing into my suitcase / on and behind the bed!
after informing the hotel, they were simply bragging how I should have let them clean my room. 

I simply need to add, I arrived on a Tuesday night - went out the next morning, when I returned Wednesday evening my room was still not cleaned! 
The next day it was put on so not disturb, for a reason :) 

so if you seriously have a cockroach problem in your hotel after just one day of not “cleaning” and then have the nerve to blame it on your guest without apologising, I‘d highly doubt a four star rating!
or standard of hospitality at all! 

the hygiene standards are a joke and actually the amount paid should be refunded!!!! 

as well:
no towels in the room, no shower mat either (after asking for a towel for the first time, I‘d only receive one, quite uncommon for a hotel) 
stains on pillows
shower was not really clean on arrival 
staff either speaks no English or only a little
after payment I had to actively ask for a receipt as a confirmation of payment - should happen on it‘s own! 
concierge would never great when entering the hotel

last but not least when the concierge brought me upstairs to the room on the night of arrival he held two keycards for the room, one he plugged in for the electricity, the other one fell out of his hands on the floor. instead of picking it up, he looked at me, made a hand gesture that I could enter the room and left.
absolutely weird!

don’t recommend - you will definitely find better hotels. I immediately checked out!",153426876,2022-04-02 09:49:51

As always Breakfast. There is a good selection of foods to cater for all tastes. The service is usually top draw also but on my second morning it was not quite up to the standards I expect, although we alI have slightly off-days but as I still enjoyed my breakfast we can perhaps excuse this minor drop in standards  on this occasion.","The In-Hotel Delicatessen - Although not directly the responsibility of the hotel they do allow an outside company to offer drinks, snacks etc on the lobby floor. I had never tried it before but on this occasion as I was feeling a little peckish around 5.30 pm I decided to try it out. I ordered a coffee, one brownie bar and two cans of small Mountain Dew soft drinks.

I paid the bill through my phone and thought I had paid SAR 55 as that is what I thought I heard and believed that was reasonable. Later that evening I checked my phone to discover that I had actually paid SAR 85. I was shocked. I checked the bill and saw that the SMALL CANS OF MOUNTAIN DEW had cost me SAR 15 each. I could not believe it. This was absolute daylight robbery. 
For sure, I will stay at the Centro again, but I will NEVER enter that delicatessen again.
